# Pull Request Description Template

When creating a pull request, follow these guidelines and use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to create the PR:

## Title Requirements
- DO NOT include commit prefixes (e.g., feat:, chore:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Capitalize the first letter of the title
- Write a clear, descriptive title that explains what the PR does

Example:
- ✅ Good: "Remove debug console.log statements"
- ❌ Bad: "chore: remove debug console.log statements"

## Description Requirements
The description must include the following three sections:

## What issue does this close?

Reference the issue number that this PR closes. The issue number should typically be found in the branch name.

Example: `Closes #1368`

## Describe what changes were introduced in this pull request

Provide a high-level overview of the changes made in this branch. Write in paragraph form without using bullet points. Focus on explaining the overall purpose and impact of the changes rather than listing individual modifications.

## Local testing

Include a checklist of testing steps that were performed or should be performed to validate the changes.

Example:
- [ ] Test item 1
- [ ] Test item 2
- [ ] Test item 3

## Creating the Pull Request

After preparing the PR description above, create the pull request using the GitHub CLI:

1. First, ensure the branch is pushed to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

2. Create the PR using `gh pr create`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<PR title>" --body "<PR description>"
   ```

   Or use a heredoc for the body:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "Your PR title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## What issue does this close?
   
   Closes #1234
   
   ## Describe what changes were introduced in this pull request
   
   Your description here...
   
   ## Local testing
   
   - [ ] Test item 1
   - [ ] Test item 2
   EOF
   )"
   ```

The command will output the URL of the created pull request.
